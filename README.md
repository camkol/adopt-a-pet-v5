### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it.

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process

- Set up React Router by installing the necessary packages and integrating the Router into your project.
- Define the initial routes to navigate between different components.
- Learn how to pass and utilize URL parameters within your components.
- Transition from traditional anchor tags to React Router's navigation elements, like `<Link>` and `<NavLink>`.
- Expand your routing by adding new routes to your application.
- Integrate a search functionality to filter or find specific content within your app.
- Create a custom page to handle cases where pet details are not found.
